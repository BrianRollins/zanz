++ Dragons

The overlords and overseers of the world, the other races work with, work for, or are slaves to these mighty, powerful beasts. Long-lived, highly intelligent, and brutally powerful, they are not to be crossed (at least not publicly). Most are content to work behind the scenes and in the shadows, only presenting themselves for ceremonial occasions or to put down a particularly irksome problem.
