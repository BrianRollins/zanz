++ Rix Stonebreaker

Dwarf woman with an aptitude for mechanics and airships. She is currently the Engineer aboard the [Daring Damsel].

Raised in a culture that puts women only in the role of mother and house keeper, Rix defied all sorts of taboos and cultural norms to escape her clan and start work on the surface as a mechanic. She's had an unorthodox training and as such, attacks problems that many “traditional” mechanics wouldn't be able to. She delights in pushing and upgrading the Damsel.
