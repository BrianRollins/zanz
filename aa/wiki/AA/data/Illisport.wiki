++ Illisport

Capitol (and only major city) of the [Shattered Isles]. Crammed onto the largest island (along with bridges to several other islands, the city is broken into districts, each with a different industry that drives them. Docks, schools, trade, and more. The city is eclectic mix of races, more so than any other place in the world. Goods are traded, modified, lost, found, stolen, and repurchased here.

The city is run by a council. This Ruling Council is comprised of representatives from each of the major guilds that do business in the city. The [Amaranthine Lady], as she's known to the populace, is a brilliant violet [Dragons|Dragon] that oversees the realm.
