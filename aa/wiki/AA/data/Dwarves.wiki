++ Dwarves

Dwarves are traditionally subterrainian dwelling people that are of short stature and long lives. They are a tough and hardy people.

They love finely crafted things, from stonework to ale. More recent generations have become less xenophobic and are beginning to embrace ideas and artwork from other cultures.

Dwarves are a patriarchal society, typically leaving women at home to care for children. There is some chaffing at this tradition among the younger generation. However, there are several old laws and traditions that keep these ways in place.

Dwarves are excellent mechanics, engineers, and architects. They have a long-standing rivalry with Goblin clans which has evolved from physical combat to feats of engineering and craft.

Some of the surface-dwelling dwarves have set this aside to work with Goblin alchemists, resulting in some of the grandest inventions to date, like mighty airships (carriers and dreadnoughts).
