++ Will Irons

First officer of the [Daring Damsel] and sentient automaton. While most automatons run basic programs and a few higher-end ones can have basic decision making, Will is well-and-truly a sentient being. This is due to the fact that encased in his abdomen is a human brain. The brain of Aleksei Litke. During Gareth's final mission with the Navy, he and Aleksei were both prisoners of a deranged scientist. While Gareth escaped with only physical wounds, Aleksei was killed and his brain harvested and mounted into an automaton. To date, this is the only known case. Irons killed the scientist with Gareth's help during their escape back to the Damsel.

To protect his friend, Gareth keeps the man aboard ship as his first officer. When people ask why he's the XO, Gareth usually quips something like "he's effecient" or "he never sleeps." Irons' true identity is known only to Gareth, Rix, and a goblin alchemist [Zan Queel] (who keeps him up and running, but doesn't know how to replicate the process).
