++ Ursans

Almost viking-like, the Ursan people value prowess in skill as the highest achievement. It can be skill with an axe or hammer, but it can also be as an artisan, cook, or even as a writer. They are fierce warriors and view the afterlife as a gift where they can work with history's greatest artists.

They have no gods, but revere their ancestors, especially those truly gifted in some art form. A select few are Paragons, renaissance men and women that excel in multiple art forms. They are the leaders and the Ursan ideal.

They respect other cultures, particularly [Dwarves] and [Goblins] who excel at certain crafts. They are not above co-opting or learning from others. They hold [Trolls] in disgust, as they create nothing of value or skill. They tolerate Humans, who don't seem to excel at anything, but are jacks-of-all-trades. Competent at many things, but never the pinnacle of ability. The few humans they encounter that do excel are respected.

In appearance, the Ursans are bear-like humanoids with thick fur around their bodies. The hair is shortest and thinnest around their hands (which are quite deft) and their faces. Their mouths and noses protrude out in a snout, making Human (Common) speech a little mangled. This can often lull other races into assuming they aren't intelligent. Their fur ranges in color from white to red to brown and even jet black.
