Captain and owner of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Daring=20Damsel" class="wikidpad">Daring Damsel</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Born to a whore in a brothel, Gareth never learned the identity of his father, who is assumed to be a nobleman of medium to high rank, based on the clientele of the Ruby Rose. He learned swordplay, tactics, reading, and art from the ladies (and the guests) of the brothel. When he was eight, his mother died. When he was twelve, the owner threw him out of the Ruby Rose when he started puberty and she didn't want him starting anything with the girls.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
On the streets, Gareth expanded his “education” by learning to steal, fence stolen goods, lie, con, and generally stay one step ahead of the law.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
When the First Grand War erupted, he was 16. He was pressed into the Navy as a crewman. He moved up through the ranks, eventually receiving a battlefield commission. The first war ended with an uneasy truce, leaving Gareth unemployed at the age of 22.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
He became a bodyguard/sword-for-hire for the next four years until tensions began to mount between Dontaria and Tarnos. A former commanding officer found Gareth and got his him reinstated as an officer. This time, he was the first officer of a blockade runner, the Brazen Bitch. The commander was a hard, cruel man that drove the crew hard, but won scores of battles.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Finally, the commander died in battle (mysterious circumstances), putting Gareth in command. The ship and crew performed admirably for several months before Gareth could put the ship in for a new commander. Gareth was formally promoted and his for the remainder of the war.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The final battle saw the end of the entire crew. When they emerged, all that was left was a bloodied and battered Bitch, Gareth, and an odd automaton, Will Irons.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The Bitch was slated for the scrap heap and Gareth was awarded prize money for capturing various airships and cargo. As he was the only survivor, he didn't have to split the money between his crew. He used most of the funds to purchase the Bitch and repair her. She was rechristened the Daring Damsel. Gareth kept Will on as the first officer. He keeps the ship afloat as a living memorial to his friends and former crew.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Seeing her abilities repairing the Damsel, Gareth offered the chief engineer post to a young dwarf woman, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Rix=20Stonebreaker" class="wikidpad">Rix Stonebreaker</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />

A Dontarian Valiant-class transport ship.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Designed to move fast and take heavy fire while delivering small amounts of cargo or troop deployments.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Long and sleek, the Damsel features four small turbine engines in her armored aft with intakes a little further up her hull. She has a copper alloy armor that's alchemically treated to withstand more punishment. The Damsel has been patched with less expensive, but less durable materials over time.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Along her port and starboard sides she has numerous hatches making loading and unloading quick.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Her bridge is located on the dorsal side, close her bow. It makes a tear-drop shaped bubble on the top of the ship. It gives visibility around the top of the ship, but is blocked just aft by curve of the ship. A secondary control station is located a deck below and is used for landings and spotting enemy craft.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The engine room occupies most of the rear of the ship, near the engines. There's an observation deck in the aft at the same level as the bridge which is used to give the crew more visibility.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
She had four lift bladders along her dorsal side. Two fore and two aft, allowing her to pitch up and down quickly. Also tucked into her aft section, toward the dorsal side are a pair of ailerons for high speed maneuvering. These fold in during bombardment to protect them and offer a smaller profile to anti-aircraft batteries.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
All the windows on the ship have armored shutters. They are closed either manually (officer berths) or automatically by machine (the bridge, landing station, and observation deck).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Built for the First Grand War, the Bitch only saw a little bit of action before the war ended. During the lull between the First and Second wars, the Valiant class was made obsolete by larger, faster vessels. The class was kept around and still saw extensive use during the second war. The Dontarian Army had become quite fond of the smaller vessels, which could slip in unnoticed and drop troops and supplies behind enemy lines. Few of the vessels survived the war as they were considered obsolete by the top brass and saw some of the most brutal combat during the war.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The Bitch herself saw her life as a military vessel come to a quick and bloody end when the entire crew (save one) was slaughtered on an ill-fated mission. The lone survivor, Gareth Black saved the ship from the scrapyard by purchasing her with his prize money from the war. He keeps the ship in as good of repair as he can as a monument to his fallen friends.<br class="wikidpad" />

<br class="wikidpad" />
Raised in a culture that puts women only in the role of mother and house keeper, Rix defied all sorts of taboos and cultural norms to escape her clan and start work on the surface as a mechanic. She's had an unorthodox training and as such, attacks problems that many “traditional” mechanics wouldn't be able to. She delights in pushing and upgrading the Damsel.<br class="wikidpad" />

First officer of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Daring=20Damsel" class="wikidpad">Daring Damsel</a></span> and sentient automaton. While most automatons run basic programs and a few higher-end ones can have basic decision making, Will is well-and-truly a sentient being. This is due to the fact that encased in his abdomen is a human brain. The brain of Aleksei Litke. During Gareth's final mission with the Navy, he and Aleksei were both prisoners of a deranged scientist. While Gareth escaped with only physical wounds, Aleksei was killed and his brain harvested and mounted into an automaton. To date, this is the only known case. Irons killed the scientist with Gareth's help during their escape back to the Damsel.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To protect his friend, Gareth keeps the man aboard ship as his first officer. When people ask why he's the XO, Gareth usually quips something like "he's effecient" or "he never sleeps." Irons' true identity is known only to Gareth, Rix, and a goblin alchemist <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Zan=20Queel" class="wikidpad">Zan Queel</a></span> (who keeps him up and running, but doesn't know how to replicate the process). <br class="wikidpad" />

Along the way, the ship is attacked and her engines are fouled. Opting not to stay still while they repair them, they set the Damsel into the river and use it to propel them downstream to their destination. The heat and constant attacks start to cause tensions to mount and tempers to flare as Rix tries desperately to fix the engines. Will tries to keep people calm, but his neutrality only pisses people off.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They find the mining camp overrun and the occupants killed. Gareth leaves Will and Rix to repair the ship, while he seeks out the hermit researcher. He takes along a few of the workers seeing as he doesn't want to leave them with his ship, lest they get any bright ideas that they'll take it.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Into the jungle, things go from bad to worse as the daughter's bodyguard abandons them in the night, taking their map and key equipment. A day later, hulking alchemical beasts capture them and take them to the researcher. He's been mutating and altering jungle beasts for research. He has some "patron" that is funding him, but the old man has clearly lost his mind. The daughter is horrified, but comes along.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Meanwhile, some of the more troublesome workers have hatched a plot to steal the Damsel and get out of the jungle while they can. Their coup is nearly successful until another attack sends them scattering into the jungle. Now Rix and Will have to repair the ship while keeping an eye out for the would-be pirates. Will is fine, but the long hours are wearing on Rix's mind and body.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Gareth and company are led off to the lab where he's separated from the rest of the team. The pair of workers that are with him are "altered" by the researcher into mindless automatons. His daughter has informed him of Will, an automaton unlike any she's ever seen. Gareth is now desperate to get free to save himself as well as his first officer.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Rix and Will have managed to keep their attackers at bay just long enough for something horrific and deadly to come out of the jungle and kill all their attackers. It's dark, so they can't see what it is, but they do manage to engage the ship's lift bladders to increase elevation to stay away from whatever it is.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With the help of the daughter, Gareth escapes, but not before tumbling with a modified version of the bodyguard. One of the modified workers breaks his conditioning and steps in to halt the brute, giving Gareth enough time to flee into the jungle, though it cost the worker his life. It's now a mad dash through the jungle for Gareth to find the Damsel and then get back to save the daughter.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
He breaks through the jungle and finds the Damsel (now conveniently high enough to be seen by him and everyone). In the mining camp clearing, he sprints for the ship, waving her down. Rix and Will wave him back into the jungle. Before he can make out what they're saying, a huge, alchemically mutated tiger bursts from the jungle. It's twice normal size and has armored plates surgically attached to it. And it's permanently pissed off.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
While Will and Rix attempt to shoot the beast, Gareth just managed to stay five feet ahead of the thing. Rix raids the mining gear they are carrying and finds dynamite. Unfortunately, she can't use it while they're on the run.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Gareth manages to put the tiger down by creating a cave-in the nearby mine with the help of Will. They are then confronted by the bodyguard holding Rix hostage. She's freaking out as the man now resembles a huge spider. While they talk, Rix manages to shove a stick of dynamite into the man's undercarriage and lights it. "Too. Many. Legs."<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
When they return to the lab, they find it cleared out. Gareth decides to strip the place of anything valuable and then use the remainder of the dynamite to blow the place to bits.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In an epilogue, the mine owner is less-than-pleased that his men are dead and his mine is collapsed. He demands the that the Damsel run back up and deliver repair crews as they failed their mission. Gareth reminds him that he did, in fact take them up to the mining camp, just that they died after that fact. As it stands, the whole job has been a loss for the crew (with repairs). As they leave, a courier drops a package for the crew. It's gold and a note from the daughter apologizing. She's going with her father, since he's the only family she has. Maybe she can reform him. She warns against following them. Just let them go. Gareth is more than willing to let them go, but he has a bad feeling they'll turn up again when they least expect it.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name="Plots#.h4772" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Swords and Plowshares</h3>
Settlers on Freehold are under attack by pirates and raiders. The settlers are comprised of veterans of the Second War who have put their differences aside (and their weapons) to build a new life. The attacks threaten to re-ignite long-dormant animosities between the settlers.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name="Plots#.h5078" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Underground</h3>
The Damsel is stuck underground and the crew have to navigate through a labyrinth to get out. Several times, Gareth has to fight to keep from abandoning the ship and just leaving on foot.<br class="wikidpad" />

Dwarves are traditionally subterrainian dwelling people that are of short stature and long lives. They are a tough and hardy people.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They love finely crafted things, from stonework to ale. More recent generations have become less xenophobic and are beginning to embrace ideas and artwork from other cultures.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Dwarves are a patriarchal society, typically leaving women at home to care for children. There is some chaffing at this tradition among the younger generation. However, there are several old laws and traditions that keep these ways in place.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Dwarves are excellent mechanics, engineers, and architects. They have a long-standing rivalry with Goblin clans which has evolved from physical combat to feats of engineering and craft.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Some of the surface-dwelling dwarves have set this aside to work with Goblin alchemists, resulting in some of the grandest inventions to date, like mighty airships (carriers and dreadnoughts).<br class="wikidpad" />

Goblins are a crafty, intelligent species. They prize cleverness over most all attributes.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Goblins make for excellent lawyers, administrators, doctors, scientists, and alchemists.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
While they have a long-standing feud with the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Dwarves" class="wikidpad">Dwarves</a></span>, they are not above putting aside these differences for gold or for a challenge.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They enjoy games of mental skill and cunning (chess, go). Games of chance (like dice) are distasteful to them, but they aren't above playing a game like poker, where skills like bluffing can offset the randomness. If a goblin is playing dice, you can bet the pieces have been rigged.<br class="wikidpad" />

Ugly, brutish, and unpleasant, Trolls make a way for themselves in the world by being bigger, meaner, and more violent than the next guy.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Their culture promotes this throughout childhood, and they feel that only by being the strongest can they survive.<br class="wikidpad" />

Almost viking-like, the Ursan people value prowess in skill as the highest achievement. It can be skill with an axe or hammer, but it can also be as an artisan, cook, or even as a writer. They are fierce warriors and view the afterlife as a gift where they can work with history's greatest artists.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They have no gods, but revere their ancestors, especially those truly gifted in some art form. A select few are Paragons, renaissance men and women that excel in multiple art forms. They are the leaders and the Ursan ideal.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They respect other cultures, particularly <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Dwarves" class="wikidpad">Dwarves</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Goblins" class="wikidpad">Goblins</a></span> who excel at certain crafts. They are not above co-opting or learning from others. They hold <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="#Trolls" class="wikidpad">Trolls</a></span> in disgust, as they create nothing of value or skill. They tolerate Humans, who don't seem to excel at anything, but are jacks-of-all-trades. Competent at many things, but never the pinnacle of ability. The few humans they encounter that do excel are respected.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In appearance, the Ursans are bear-like humanoids with thick fur around their bodies. The hair is shortest and thinnest around their hands (which are quite deft) and their faces. Their mouths and noses protrude out in a snout, making Human (Common) speech a little mangled. This can often lull other races into assuming they aren't intelligent. Their fur ranges in color from white to red to brown and even jet black.<br class="wikidpad" />
